# Cyrillic Che in a Pinyin draft

> It was a directly borrowed Che, having nothing to do with "h". Descending or not was typographical.

> Of course it's not normal, it was borrowed from into Pinyin because its resemblance of ㄐ's sound and shape. It's simply not a normal usage.

> You'd know ㄐ is relevant to Ч's introduction in the draft if you really dug into Pinyin's history and did your homework for this proposal.

> And the Old Latin Zhuang's tonal mark Ч is what really not relevant to this Pinyin draft topic.

> If Cyrillic chars r not acceptable, whether it's "Latin Che" or "Latin Descending Che" is arguable. But it's not Ɥɥ if u want an case pair.

> Чч's look is not consistent in materials of this Pinyin draft. I don't see why "f" is the only letter that can have an optional descender.

> And we all know pretty well draft Pinyin Чч never got widely used outside of experimental docs to have a real world letterform convention.

> Are you proposing a new character for the capital ŋ in this Pinyin draft because it looks different to common Ŋ?

> Oh c'mon. I "think"? "Compelling"? Чч's origin is a recorded history and I read those books when did my BA thesis and you guys should too.

> It doesn't get a descender in your previously known use cases. People extend a letter's typographical forms all the time.

> Now u hv a problem: Ɥɥ's lc looks like what u think is the standard glyph in the draft, and Чч's uc looks like that. So which one do u pick?

> Even if u think I'm making things up, what do u mean by "ㄐ [ʨ] is not more compelling than Cyrl Ч [tʃ]"? R u aware in this draft Ч is ㄐ/J?

> I don't have a problem with considering it Latin Che. It's not script properties that I talk about. See my comment: https://twitter.com/lianghai/status/822102135269535744

> But I don't actually think we need to encode a new char for every letterform invented in every temporary draft work on this planet.

> It's important to understand this is letterforms in a draft of Pinyin we're talking about. It never got a user base. Cyrl chars work here.

> Draft Pinyin Чч is NOT normal itself! A Cyrl letter borrowed into a DRAFT is NOT a normal use case. And its letterform was NOT consistent.

> I'm talking about why they borrowed Чч for this sound. They said in those books Чч looked like ㄐ so Чч got one more reason to be borrowed.
